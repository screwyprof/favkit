A modern Rust library and CLI tool for managing macOS Finder favorites. This project is a modern replacement for the abandoned [mysides](https://github.com/mosen/mysides) tool.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/screwyprof/favkit/releases)
2. Unzip the downloaded file:
   ```bash
   unzip favkit-macos.zip
   ```
3. Remove quarantine:
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine favkit
   ```
4. Move to a directory in your PATH (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo mv favkit /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Create a maintained alternative to `mysides` for managing macOS Finder favorites
2. **Learning**: Serve as a Rust programming kata exploring:
   - Clean Architecture principles
   - Outside-In TDD (London School)
   - Domain-Driven Design
   - Modern development practices with nix + direnv

## Status: ðŸš§ Under Development

This project is currently in alpha stage. Progress and next steps:

âœ… **Completed**:
- Basic viewing of Finder favorites
- Proper display names for special locations:
  - AirDrop: Shows as "AirDrop" without exposing internal URL
  - Recents: Shows as "Recents" without exposing internal URL
  - Applications: Shows as "Applications" without exposing internal URL

ðŸš§ **In Progress**:
- User-friendly path formatting (show regular paths instead of raw URLs)

ðŸ”œ **Planned**:
- Handle special locations:
  - User Desktop (`file:///Users/<user>/Desktop/`)
  - User Downloads (`file:///Users/<user>/Downloads/`)
- Add/remove favorites
- Command-line interface improvements
