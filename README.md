# FavKit v3

A modern Rust library and CLI tool for managing macOS Finder favorites. This project is a modern replacement for the abandoned `mysides` tool.

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Create a maintained alternative to `mysides` for managing macOS Finder favorites
2. **Learning**: Serve as a Rust programming kata exploring:
   - Clean Architecture principles
   - Outside-In TDD (London School)
   - Domain-Driven Design
   - Modern development practices with nix + direnv

## Status: ðŸš§ Under Development

This project is currently in alpha stage. We're following an iterative development approach, starting with viewing favorites functionality.
